                        Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are
                        programmed to think and learn like humans. These systems can perform tasks such as recognizing
                        speech, making decisions, translating languages, and more. AI is a broad field that encompasses
                        various subfields, including machine learning, neural networks, and natural language processing.

                        AI systems work by using algorithms and large datasets to identify patterns and make predictions
                        or decisions. Machine learning, a subset of AI, involves training models on data so they can
                        improve over time. Neural networks, inspired by the human brain, are a key technology in AI that
                        enable deep learning. Key components include data collection, algorithm selection, model
                        training, and evaluation.

                        AI has 7 classifications that are determined by two points: its capacity and its technical
                        classification.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In terms of its capacity, this relates to the level of intelligence of the AI, meaning its
                        ability to perform human-like functions. These abilities are divided into four categories:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Reactive Machines:</strong> These are the oldest forms of artificial intelligence,
                            which do not have functionality based on memory.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Limited Memory:</strong> These can learn based on historical data.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Theory of Mind:</strong>This is the next level of AI systems that is currently in
                            development.

                        <li>
                            <strong>Self-aware:</strong> Self-aware AI is a hypothetical formulation that will be able
                            to understand and evoke emotions, needs, beliefs, and potentially its own desires.
                        </li>

                    <p>
                        Now, regarding the technical classification of artificial intelligence, we should focus on three

                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI):</strong> This represents all existing AI,
                            which can only
                            perform a specific task.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI):</strong> This refers to the capability of
                            general artificial intelligence to learn, perceive, understand, and function completely like
                            a human being.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Artificial Superintelligence (ASI):</strong> This can replicate the multifaceted
                            intelligence of

                        The automation of manual tasks and the replication of human consciousness have always been
                        topics in
                        scientific debate, predating even the invention of computers. Studies on neural networks and the
                        methods by which a machine can perform tasks like the human brain gained momentum in the 20th
                        century, definitively expanding from the 1950s onwards.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        One of the key figures in science and considered the father of computing, Alan Turing
                        (1912-1954),
                        wrote one of the most comprehensive studies of the period on the subject. The article "Computing
                        Machinery and Intelligence" was published in 1950 and was the first to mention the term
                        "artificial
                        intelligence." In it, Turing proposed a test to evaluate whether machines have the ability to
                        emulate human thought and pass as a person to the point of confusing questioners, which became
                        known
                        as the "Turing Test."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the subsequent period, many studies and research projects were developed to test Turing's
                        proposal, with a highlight being the program Eliza, created by computer scientist Joseph
                        Weizenbaum
                        (1923-2008) in 1966, which achieved relative success but also faced considerable criticism.
                        Before
                        that, researchers at Stanford University in California (United States) launched in 1965 what is
                        considered the pioneering system in artificial intelligence, called Dendral.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Since then, many advances have been made in the field of computer science, robotics, and
                        artificial
                        intelligence, to the point where these concepts and elements are part of our daily lives. In the
                        more recent period, the emergence of algorithms capable of directly interacting with humans
                        through
                        language and dialogue development, like Chat GPT, and others capable of generating images with
                        just
                        a few commands, has sparked intense debate in society about the role of artificial intelligence
                        and
                        the limits of these tools.

                    <p>
                        The future of AI points towards and urges for increasingly transparent technology, ethically
                        built,
                        and integrated into daily tasks, whether at work or in our personal lives, enhancing our
                        cognitive
                        abilities.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        AI can make humans more productive, freeing professionals from certain mechanical and repetitive
                        tasks so they can use their full capacity to create and innovate in other sectors. A change in
                        the
                        job market has begun, and certainly, this will eliminate some jobs in the future.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But speaking from an optimistic perspective, Alessandro Jannuzzi, Director of Engineering and
                        Innovation at Microsoft Brazil, states that the company has committed to democratizing access to
                        AI.
                        “We are looking for the necessary resources in AI to help solve the most urgent problems in our
                        society. In this sense, our approach is divided into three pillars: leading innovations that
                        enhance
                        human capacity; building powerful platforms that make innovation faster and more accessible; and
                        developing a reliable approach that puts the customer in control and protects their data,” he
                        explained.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It is worth noting that in the business world, if you are not being disruptive in your sector,
                        certainly someone else is. And AI can be the greatest ally in contributing to the kind of
                        digital
                        transformation that companies seek so much. Combined with human capacity, it can drive people to
                        do
                        amazing things.
